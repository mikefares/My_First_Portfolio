        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Growing up in Ghana, a country in the western part of Africa, 
            I was always fascinated by technology. The idea of self-driving cars, 
            simple robots, and the exciting worlds created by virtual reality 
            (VR) and augmented reality (AR) captivated my imagination. The workings 
            of computers and the potential to transform dreams into digital 
            realities inspired me to complete my undergraduate studies with a 
            Bachelor&apos;s degree in Computer Engineering at Ghana Communication 
            Technology University, Accra in 2021. I dream of one day contributing 
            to the world of tech by blending my African heritage with the 
            innovations and advancements of the modern world.</p>

            <h3>Fyyur App</h3>
            <p>Fyyur is a musical venue and artist booking site that facilitates the discovery and bookings of shows between local performing artists and venues. This site lets you list new artists and venues, discover them, and list shows with artists as a venue owner.</p>

            <h3>Trivia API</h3>
            <p>Udacity is invested in creating bonding experiences for its employees and students. A bunch of team members got the idea to hold trivia on a regular basis and created a webpage to manage the trivia app and play the game, but their API experience is limited and still needs to be built out.

That's where you come in! Help them finish the trivia app so they can start holding trivia and seeing who's the most knowledgeable of the bunch. </p>

    <section id="about">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>An experience that cemented my dedication to higher education was working on my final year project, which focused on using Face Recognition and Object Detection in schools to detect intruders. The technology aims to enhance security measures by identifying possible threats like guns or other weapons in images captured by cameras. This endeavor was influenced by the tragic events of the Boku Haram kidnappings of school children in Nigeria. It fueled my resolve to develop a system to enhance school security and create safer educational environments for students.</p>
